# Handwritten_digit_recognition
A Machine Learning model for recognising the handwritten digits given at runtime.

This model takes an input of 28x28 image containing a digit and classify it between 0 to 9.

### Steps Followed:
  1. Loading the MNIST dataset.
  2. Scaling the dataset.
  3. Fitting the training data and calculatin accuracy
  4. Runtime detection using OpenCV.
  
Accuracy reached: 96%
